\section{Concluding remarks}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this article, we proposed for the first time the system $\TPlus$ of
$\lambda$-calculus featuring the simplest support for delaying
$\alpha$-coversion of function arguments in $\beta$-reduction.
To that aim, our system needs an extension of $\beta$-reduction known
as balanced or distant $\beta$-reduction.

The system comes in two versions.
The main version $\TFrePlus$ features depth-indexed variable references (Section 5),
while the alternative version $\TCarPlus$ features named variable references (Appendix B).

As we saw, $\TPlus$ is confluent
and weak normalization implies strong normalization.
Moreover, we can map each term of $\TPlus$ to a term of
traditional $\lambda K$ so that each $\beta$-reduction step in $\TPlus$
corresponds to a $\beta$-reduction step in $\lambda K$ and vice versa.

The first author, being experienced in computer-assisted proof verification,
is checking the present theory of $\TFrePlus$ with Matita \cite{ARST11}
and plans to report on this activity in future work.
Moreover, we plan to relate $\TPlus$ to
other systems featuring delayed $\alpha$-conversion
like the ones we mentioned in Section 2.
