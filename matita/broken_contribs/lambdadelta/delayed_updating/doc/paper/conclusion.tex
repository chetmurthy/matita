\section{Concluding remarks}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this article we proposed for the first time the system $\TPlus$ of
$\lambda$-calculus featuring the simplest suppport for delaying
$\alpha$-coversion of function arguments in $\beta$-reduction.
To that aim our system needs an extension of $\beta$-reduction known
as balanced or distant $\beta$-reduction.

The system comes with two presentations as to variable references.
The main presentation $\TFrePlus$ has depth-indexed references (Section 5)
but we give the presentation $\TCarPlus$ having named references as well (Appendex B).

As we saw, $\TPlus$ is confluent
and weak normalization implies strong normalization.
Moreover, we can map each term of $\TPlus$ to a term of
traditional $\lambda K$ so that each $\beta$-reduction step in $\TPlus$
corresponds to a $\beta$-reduction step in $\lambda K$ and vice versa.

The first author, being experienced in computer-assisted proof verification,
is checking the present theory of $\TFrePlus$ with Matita \cite{ARST11}
and plans to report on this activity in future work.
Moreover, we plan to relate $\TPlus$ to
other systems featuring delayed $\alpha$-conversion
like the ones we mentioned in Section 2.
