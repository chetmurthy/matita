\section{Introduction}

It is well known that practical implementations of $\lambda$-calculus
turn $\alpha$-equivalence into syntactic equality
by representing bound variable occurrences
with depth indexes or level indexes \cite{Bru72}.
Generally speaking, function application involves replacing the
occurrences of the independent variables in the function's body
with copies of the function's arguments
and, in this scenario, the indexes occurring in such copies
may need an update to prevent captures.
Experience shows that this update,
known as lift according to a well-established terminology,
is a time consuming operation \cite[Appendix A2]{lambdadeltaR2a}
that, precisely, computing machines strive to avoid \cite{Klu05}.

In a family of systems originating from \cite{Bru78a}
and $\lambda\sigma$ \cite{ACCL91}
$\beta$-reductions insert information on updates in the copied terms
instead of updating them.
Thus a computation can delay updates at will
or apply them whenever is the case.

The system we present in this article for the first time
lies in this family. Contrary to its predecessors,
it is based just on $\beta$-reduction at a distance,
an extension of $\beta$-reduction introduced in \cite{Ned73},
and the information on updates stored in terms
consists just of single positive integers.
